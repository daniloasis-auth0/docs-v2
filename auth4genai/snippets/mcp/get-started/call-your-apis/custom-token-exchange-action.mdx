This Action is the server-side logic Auth0 executes to perform the token exchange. It is necessary because the MCP server receives an access token from the client (with the MCP server as its audience) and must exchange it for a new token (with the upstream API as the audience). This Action validates the original token and mints the new one.

The Custom Token Exchange Action is available as part of Custom Token Exchange Early Access. Navigate to [the On-behalf-of token exchange for first-party apps template available here](https://manage.auth0.com/#/actions/library/templates/templates/daeda4e8-8da2-4abb-afb5-ac09df0ebb2a) and click on **Use This Template**.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/img/mcp/cte_action_template_page.png"
    alt="Action On-behalf-of token exchange for first-party apps template page"
  />
</Frame>

This will open a modal for you to name the action:

<Frame>
  <img
    class="img-sizing"
    src="/img/mcp/cte_action_creation_modal.png"
    alt="Action creation modal"
  />
</Frame>

Once the action is created, you can **Deploy** it. When you deploy the Action, Auth0 assigns it an Action ID. You still need to add your custom logic to the Action, but first, get the Action ID to create the Custom Token Exchange Profile.
