To call your APIs on behalf of your users, the MCP server needs to exchange the Auth0 access token it received from the MCP client (with the audience set to the MCP server itself) for a new Auth0 access token with the audience set to your API.

In Auth0, this is called Custom Token Exchange and uses [RFC 8693](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693.html). This flow involves the MCP server acting as both a resource server (for the client) and a client (for the upstream API).

By the end of this quickstart, you should have an MCP server that can:

* Exchange an Auth0 access token for another Auth0 access token with a different audience using Custom Token Exchange
* Verify the access token using the `@auth0/auth0-api-js` library (which uses `jose` under the hood) or the `auth0-api-python` library for Python against your tenant JWKS, enforcing issuer, audience, and RS256

## Set up the Auth0 Applications and APIs

When an MCP server needs to call underlying APIs, it needs to perform a Custom Token Exchange to obtain an access token with the audience set to the API rather than the MCP server itself. Because of this architecture, the MCP server acts in a dual role.

1. To the MCP client (e.g., an IDE, an AI assistant), the MCP server acts as a **Resource Server** (an API).
2. To the underlying API (e.g., your own API), the MCP server acts as a **Client**.

Because of this, you will set up the MCP server twice on your Auth0 tenant, both as an API and as a Client.

### Create an API to represent your MCP server

<CreateMCPAPI />

<AssignPermissionsToRoles />

### Create an Application for your MCP server

In the custom token exchange scenario, the MCP server acts as a client in order to obtain an Auth0 access token with custom token exchange:

```shell wrap lines
auth0 api post clients --data '{
  "name": "MCP Server Client",
  "app_type": "resource_server",
  "oidc_conformant": true,
  "resource_server_identifier": "http://localhost:3001/",
  "token_exchange": {
    "allow_any_profile_of_type": ["custom_authentication"]
  }
}' | jq -c '{client_id, client_secret}' > auth0-app-details.json
```

The output of the command will be a JSON object with the `client_id` and `client_secret` of the newly created client, which will be used in the next steps to configure the MCP server environment.

And finally, because you need an API to call to, let's create one.

### Create a first-party API to call from the MCP server

Since your objective is to have the MCP server make a tool call that calls a protected first-party API you need to configure an API in Auth0, this will be your upstream API:

```shell
auth0 api post resource-servers --data '{
  "identifier": "http://localhost:8787/",
  "name": "Protected First Party API",
  "signing_alg": "RS256",
  "enforce_policies": true,
  "scopes": [
    {"value": "read:private", "description": "Private scope"}
  ]
}' | jq -r '"Audience: " + .identifier'
```

Save the `Audience` from the command output; you'll need it in a later step.

        Start by downloading the sample app for this quickstart. The sample includes a FastMCP MCP server with an Auth0 integration and a protected API built with
        [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/).

        <DownloadQuickstartButton
          category="auth-for-mcp"
          framework="fastmcp-mcp-customtokenexchange-js"
        />

        Once downloaded, extract the files and open the project in your preferred IDE.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Clone GitHub repository">
        Clone the repository and navigate to the sample app folder which includes a FastMCP MCP server with an Auth0 integration and a protected API built with
        [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/).

        ```shell wrap lines
        git clone https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-ai-samples.git
        cd auth0-ai-samples/auth-for-mcp/fastmcp-mcp-customtokenexchange-js
        ```

        Once cloned, open the project in your preferred IDE.
