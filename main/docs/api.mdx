## Pagination

For Public Cloud tenants, Management API endpoints return a maximum of 50 results per response. When there are more results than can be returned in a response, include the `page` and `per_page` parameters in your request to retrieve more results.

See [Migrate to Management API v2 Endpoint Paginated Queries](/docs/troubleshoot/product-lifecycle/past-migrations/migrate-to-paginated-queries) for information on updating your applications.
